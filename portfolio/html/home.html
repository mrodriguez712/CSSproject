		<h1>Marte Rodriguez Homepage</h1>
	<p class="hpage">My name is Marte Rodriguez. I was born and raised in the Philippines but moved here in Seattle, 
	Washington in 2001 when I was 15 years old. That time, I had experienced culture shock, because everything
	was new to me. I was also very shy and a huge introvert, so it took a while before I got used to be away 
	from my friends in my home country and from the culture I used to live in. 
	<br><br>
	Eventually, I have adapted to a new way of living here in America. I graduated high school before I turned
	20 and soon after graduating, I started to look for a job. Again, it took me a while for me to find a job
	because I didn’t have that confidence in me when it comes to interviews. Finally, I was hired as an 
	audio-visual technician at a hotel.
	<br><br>
	I had a total of 7 jobs from 2006 to 2019, and throughout those years, I’ve always thought of going back
	to school. I have always been interested in computers, have been fond of video games since I was young. 
	Growing up, I wrote so many stories and drew a lot of cartoons/anime for a video game. Though 2020 might 
	not be considered a good year because of the pandemic, it did pave a way for my dream to come true. 
	I started to take classes to be a web developer, and let me tell you, I am enjoying coding, and learning 
	more and more. I even have a game App that would make me code more.
	<br><br>
	For the next couple of years, my goals are to get a degree for Web Application and Cloud Developer; and 
	get a job as soon as possible. My family is my number one inspiration right now. I want to be able to give
	them a good life while doing something I am passionate about.
