	I'm so excited and happy to share my very first web page! <br>It took me a while to finish the design and I feel like there
	are more things I could do. However, I think it is good enough for now, but I am planning to keep coming 
	back to it to add new things from what I will learn in the near future. <br>Ever since I started to learn 
	coding this fall, I have been researching and playing coding games on my phone because I'm so addicted
	to it. I enjoyed it so much that I cannot wait to learn more than what I know now. It has been great 
	taking prerequisite subjects last spring and summer, but as soon as fall classes started, I became more
	enthusiastic in finishing the lab assignments that I want to do more for of it. That's how much I enjoyed
	creating this website and taking the class! <br>I will keep holding on to the future and succeed in capturing
	my goal.</p>
